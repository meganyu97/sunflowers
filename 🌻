we have the sunflowers because van gogh 
had a brother who loved him
through all the pain, he had a tether 
a connection to the world - hannah gadsby

sunflowers follow the path of the sun
with each dawn and dusk, they dance from east to west
always using the night to turn back
knowing the sun will rise again

my petals have been falling down 
with each day it becomes harder and harder to follow the sun
night lends disarray to the comfort ive found in chaos
and i don't believe the sun anymore
when he says he'll be there in the morning

my tether is withering away
